# 🧠 React Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects and practice exercises I built while learning **React.js**. Each folder represents a different concept, ranging from the basics of JSX and components to more advanced hooks and state management techniques.

## 🚀 Overview

Throughout my React learning journey, I explored key concepts by building practical mini-applications and experiments. 
These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of how React works — from rendering UI to handling user input 
and managing component state. As well as teaching me how to use React Dev Tools for debugging.


Some examples include:
- 🧾 **Registration Screen** – a simple form using controlled components and validation  https://w5wst9.csb.app/
- ⏰ **Real-Time Clock App** – displays live time using the `useEffect` hook.  https://4j5g2h.csb.app/
- 😄 **Emoji Dictionary** – search and display emoji meanings using `map()` and event handling  https://4w66rm.csb.app/
- ✅ **To-Do List** – add and remove tasks with dynamic rendering.  https://rkmz5g.csb.app/
- 🎨 **Styling Experiments** – inline, modular, and conditional styling in React
